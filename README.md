# Fraud-Detection-based-on-Synthetic-Financial-Datasets
With the large amount of transactions and the changing characteristics carried out by fraudulent agents, the current methods in detecting fraud lack effectiveness. Most of the detection mechanisms are only based on simple assigned thresholds. For example, in this case only transactions over $200,000 would be flagged as fraudulent. Therefore, it is necessary to figure out the key features that are closely related to fraud so that we are able to prevent fraudulent transactions.

We trained several different classification models based on the transaction data we have in order to find the best one that can accurately detect fraudulent transactions. To this end, we attempted logistic regression, neural network and XGBoost in both PySpark and SageMaker.

We used Synthetic Financial Datasets for Fraud Detection from Kaggle. The data was generated by the PaySim mobile money simulator. Details about this simulator and the assumptions it makes can be found either on the Kaggle Site (https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim 1) or its research publication (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31313 8956_PAYSIM_A_FINANCIAL_MOBILE_M ONEY_SIMULATOR_FOR_FRAUD_DETEC TION)
